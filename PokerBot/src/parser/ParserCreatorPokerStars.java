/**
 * This class parses the hand history which is made by the poker-stars-creator into a hand-
 * history-object. This class is not finish implemented because after some tests PokerStars
 * updated their software and it was not possible to use the poker-stars-creator. The problem
 * was that you could not use copy-paste on the table chat and the poker-stars-creator uses
 * the table chat for creating the hand history of the game.
